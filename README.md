# Algorithms
A reference collection of algorithms and functionalities.

I realized I wanted a deeper understanding of runtimes, recursion, and algorithm analysis so I made this repo to store and test some of the theories and examples I have been reading up on.

These files will be build in python, but they can very easily be written using other languages.

Reference: To write out the code in this repo and to get a better understanding of algorithms and runtimes, I am referencing Grokking Algorithms by Aditya Y. Bhargava
Please give the book a read if you have not, it is worth the time.
